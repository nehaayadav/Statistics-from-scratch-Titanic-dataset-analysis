# Statistics-from-scratch-Titanic-dataset-analysis
ðŸ“Š Titanic Dataset â€“ Statistics From Scratch

This project explores the Titanic dataset using basic statistics from scratch without relying heavily on built-in library functions (like pandas .mean() or numpy .var()). The goal is to understand and implement core statistical concepts manually.

ðŸš€ Project Flow
1. Data Preprocessing
Load Titanic dataset (train.csv).
Handle missing values (e.g., drop rows where Age is NaN).


2. Basic Statistics (From Scratch)
Implemented functions for:
Mean, Median, Mode
Variance, Standard Deviation
Range, Quartiles, IQR

3. Covariance & Correlation
Covariance function implemented from scratch.
Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)
Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC)

4. Probability Distributions
Bernoulli Distribution 
Binomial Distributions
Uniform Distribution
Gaussian / Normal Distribution
Log-Normal Distrbutiobn

PDF plot with calculated mean and variance
